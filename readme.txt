This set of pages is meant to demonstrate some common performance issues.
"slow.html" is a page with several performance issues, and "optimized.html" is a page with improved performance. 

“answers.html” is a page with hints to guide the performance test, and a list of identified performance issues along with their solutions that are implemented on the optimized page.

A tester or developer can use performance testing tools such as Google Lighthouse to identify the performance issues on the "Slow" page, and review the differences compared to the "Optimized" page.
