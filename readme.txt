This set of pages is meant to demonstrate common performance issues.
"slow.html" is a page with several performance issues, and "optimized.html" is a page with improved performance.
A tester or developer can use performance testing tools such as Google Lighthouse to identify the performance issues on the "Slow" page, and review the differences compared to the "Optimized" page.
A Hints and Answers page will be added to guide the performance test and explain the differences between the two pages.
